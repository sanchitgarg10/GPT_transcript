 Either you trust us or you don't trust us. If you trust us be patient. At times it may appear we're not being fair to you. But you show me cases where we have not been fair to people for let's say 5 years. 7 years. Show me cases. Look around the organization. See people. See how they have done. And see if we have been unfair to people over a medium to long term period. Sometimes in the short term, life is never going to be 100% fair. We may not be able to identify everybody. We may not be able to be fair to everyone in the short term. That's why I say before 5 years we consider you a new journey. Before 5 years of over. So be patient. It's 2023. The business of online comparison platform seems old fashioned. Sure. People may land upon them via search engines but few would really transact through them. And if the underlying products being compared are as high value and life altering as insurance then doubly so. Right. Wrong. Policy bizarre. Not just India's but the world's largest insurance comparison and transaction platform proves that. I'm Rohan Dharmukh Kumar, your host and welcome back to another episode of First Principles. Policy bizarre started out in 2008 and is today publicly listed. It's the largest in its space by far. Many of the things it does or how it does don't fit into easy patterns that we've been used to. For instance, the fact that employees making phone calls to prospective customers is at the core of their business. In an era where we are told phone calls and call centers are a relic of the past. I brought this up many times in my conversation today with Yashish Dahia, the co-founder and group CEO of Policy Bazaar. He attributes many such decisions to policy bazaar being fundamentally first principles driven. Yashish is incredibly energetic and driven. He's a serious sportsman and triathlete. He's also as straight talking and candid as they come. We cover a lot of ground in our conversation. Why he calls policy bazaar an education platform and not a comparison one. How policy bazaar stumbled on the call center model and how it became one of its strongest differentiators. Why founders and companies need to think really hard about their right to win. Why anyone who spent less than five years and policy bazaar is still considered fresh. How he spots and grooms talent and the importance of physical endurance and excellence. I hope you enjoy the conversation as much as I do.

The exact link is mentioned in the show notes too in case you would prefer to just click. Hi, Ashish. I want to start with this apocryphal story. I've heard of you from various people much before I met you for the first time, which is the story of when you were studying at IIT Delhi and you were staying in Noida. If you couldn't find transportation back home, there have been times when you decided to just run from IIT Delhi to Noida, which is probably what, like 25-30 kilometers. It was about 22 kilometers, but yeah, it's very true. It was not a... It was actually more often than your words suggest. And it was a very practical thing, yeah. It was just... Just to be a bus. So I had to come out of my house, walk to the bus stand, then take the bus to Central Secretariat, which is the middle of Delhi, and then change bus there, and then take the next bus, which would come to IIT Delhi Gate. And then from IIT Delhi Gate, I would have to walk to my hostel, which was a walk of about two kilometers from IIT Delhi Gate to my hostel. And this whole process would take me about two hours, right? Now, if you would appreciate, I was a runner, and a 22 kilometer run used to be about 1 hour, 30, 30, 40 minutes, that was a good runner. So it will actually quicker. Plus, in a day, I had to do a run, or in a week, I had to do a certain number of runs, just generally because I used to always do that. So it was one item ticked off the list. And I've been a practical person in terms of, you know, how do I manage my luggage and all? Like, even today, for example, I never take my swimming trunks or my swimming kit out of my car. And because you never know when you may need to swim. No, because why would I bother picking it up when I have to go for a swim? And I just dried in the car. Now, I know for some people that could be disgusting. For me, it's just a practical thing. So I find it weird when, you know, the whole family is rushing about trying to get their stuff together. And I'm like, what are we even waiting for? So even when I'm traveling, like, you may know that, like, I live in the UK and I live here. I don't carry clothes across the two places. I just go with my handbag because I have a set of clothes there and I have a set of clothes here. And I need very few. But I just think, as I think through life, I'm usually a practical decision maker. It's not made out of any bravado that I'm a great runner and anything of that sort. It is just a practical decision. And then I also had an atlas protein that time in the cycle. It would take me 35 minutes or so to come in the cycle. So cycle. So every weekend, it would either be a run or a cycle. I would never go by the bus and I didn't have any other mode of transport. Now, but it was impractical to go by the bus. You know, you're going through Delhi heat, you know, drenched along with in fact, like sardines and a bus. Why would you do that? Right? And it was a beautiful run or cycle along Jamiya, Melya, Suraj, Gourmed. It was a beautiful place here, which otherwise I would never see, right? If I went by the bus. So it was a very practical thing. It wasn't anything. That's not because I thought I was unique or anything of that sort. Thank you for clearing that. From that, I want to jump to policy with that directly. I'd met Sanjeev Bikchandani a couple of days ago and he told me that the first time when you had approached him for an investment, your pitch was, Sanjeev, you're probably paying 60% more for your car premium and Sanjeev was like, it's impossible. How do you know that? And then you just proceeded to essentially like, you know, prove to him how it was like ended up showing him 40% off or 50% off. And then what did you think the opportunity was for policy Bazar and how has that scale to the opportunity that you see today for policy? So by the way, Sanjeev, I did not understand health insurance and life insurance at all. Today policy Bazar, 90% of our value lies in health insurance and life insurance, not in motor insurance. So at that time, I was coming from, by value, you mean the premiums that you collect? I mean the opportunity from premium perspective also 75% of our premiums, actually little more than that are from health and life. And I did not even know the health and life business at that stage. I did not even know that how health insurance policies are, how they are constructed, I had no clue. So I was going to know a very simple thought process that in motor insurance comparison is important. And I was coming from a European context where you know comparison was a big part of the market. However, my thinking transformed quite a bit in the one year after I met Sanjeev. And actually that is when policy Bazar, see today policy Bazar is a unique platform across the world. But the germination of all of that actually happened in that one year, not before that. And Sanjeev agreed to invest on just the motor story. And today also whenever we discuss, Sanjeev almost always speaks about the motor story. What I understood as time progressed is that motor was a very small map of, so in the UK for example, which is a much smaller country. There are about 32 million cars. In India at that time, there were about 10 million cars. Today there may be 15, 20 million. But I'm saying much smaller than a country which is much, which is, it's a population of only 16 million people. And the second part was the value of the cars in India is about half to one third of the value of the cars there because mostly we have Suzuki and Hyundai's about there, the standard, you know, car would be not Suzuki and Hyundai. So you can, Hyundai don't think we'll be 10% of the cars there, right? So I think one got to a conclusion that very quickly because I had another side effect to me, which was that my dad was in the army and I had lived in the UK. So I had seen social security everywhere. And so it was, and I'm a very long term thinking person. So it was very scary for me to live without social security. And that was a big, big, you know, so what was this? What happened in this one year when you said that? I, so do appreciate that I was pretty much for the first time living in India. I had not lived much here. So I did not, I did not know the social security aspect very well. So two things happened. One of the realized that this country is in dire need of life insurance and health insurance because if a person expires or a person falls sick, they actually have no financial recourse, right? I think that's the falling sick is the single biggest contributor to families falling under the poverty line in India. Yeah. And, and death and disability. And I have lots and lots of stories. In the sense, I had one of my mother's brothers. So most of us have gone to the army. And so we don't know the concept of not having social security because till the end of life, one is covered by a pension and a health cover and everything. This gentleman could not join the army because while he had gotten through to the NDA, in that interim phase before he was supposed to join, he was jumping over the holy, holy fire, it was a holy key fire. And that is like God bird, which disqualified him from joining the army. And so they joined the civil. And what you realized is over time, not having that social security, not having that safety net kept bringing poverty to him one incident after another. And we socially moved very, very apart. Despite the fact that his salary was not very different from what he would have received in the army. Right. But just other events and not having social security. So I think I do realize the need for social security a little more clearly than other people. And I felt that the market just did not have that. So education on that and selling those products was the second thing that happened is I went to my father's policies. This is the 2008 year. And when I met Sanjeev, the crash had not happened. And by the time Sanjeev had invested, the crash had happened. So info, I just own share price was down by I think about 70% in that phase. And I think it's only Sanjeev who invested. Otherwise, people would not have kept to their word. But that's a side story. The real story in this time was I, my father, who had been getting 7% returns every year through his savings plans, which were market linked at that time, which you don't have any clue of. But he used to get 7% return every year while the market was growing 70% every year. From 2003 to 2008, the market grew almost 70% every year. Now in 2008, the market fell to about 40% of its value. And when that happened, my father's investments fell to 25% of their value because they lost. He was also paying costs. And so the very enlightening experience for me and I'm not saying anything good or bad out of this. But the experience was me telling my father that look, these are market linked plans, which he did not know about. And then telling him that look, the person who sold these to you made so much money from you, he could not believe that number because he had invested about 20 lakh rupees. And so I explained to him that the person has made between 5 to 9 lakh rupees from you. He said that's impossible. So I say which was like a protection kind of. Not protection at all. He did not even know he was buying insurance. He thought he was buying savings because he used to invest in FDs. He said, yeah, expect tax much higher. This is like FD. This is a great plan. I'm just telling you the exact story. So we invited the agent to go back home. And I made the agent sit down in front of my father because he wouldn't believe me because he said this guy is that he studied abroad. He doesn't have a clue what's going on. He started to educate me. I am the guy who really knows the market here and I cannot be fooled. It wasn't about whether it's a good product or a bad product, but it was not according to his understanding. So where I made the person sit down, that person admitted that yes, the minimum he made from my father was about 5 lakh rupees. Very bad. I still remember that day. My dad has been a commando dagger in the Indian army. He has his own capabilities that give us having tea at that time. He just said one thing. Chai DJ, keep all the cars out of the house. I have not seen him that angry kind of ever. Because he is the person who's got very hard earned money like all of us who had just given 5 lakhs to somebody for things that he did not understand at all and he was totally missoared. And he said you should do something about this. You need to educate people. And so our first campaign was a little bit better. But when we did that campaign, we got a lot of pushback from the industry that you cannot be negative. And since then we've never had a negative campaign. We've always said, yeah, let's focus on our health insurance and terminus. And slowly, slowly the industry will automatically move towards positive. Let's not focus on all the best selling and all the bad communication that happens in the industry because that's not something we want to waste our time on. But the whole day we can't change everything in the industry overnight. Garan. Policy Bazaar is a listed company. It's been around for everyone knows it. But still I'd like you to explain to me in a line or two what is policy Bazaar? Policy Bazaar is today. It is different from what how it started is today an educator to the consumer or the need for protection against death, disease and disability. But if you have death disease and disability, there's a financial impact. Policy Bazaar educates you on how to make sure that financial impact is taken care of. Scurries you use the word educator because you're not a university. At the end of the day. We spent 2000 crore rupees. I think television commercials saying health insurance life insurance is a must for you. I don't know how else to call myself. That's my biggest expenditure till date. And my biggest loss as well. And that's the brand policy Bazaar. That's what it stands for. By the way, in the last five years, about 85% of my advertising has been on those two lines alone. And you must buy more health insurance. You must buy more life insurance. If you speak to me anytime, at least 70% of the time I will spend on explaining just this one concept for you. So how do I call myself anything else but that? And how do you make money? We make money whenever you purchase the health insurance life insurance. We get paid a certain amount by the insurance company. You said earlier in the conversation that we are the largest of our kind globally. And that is true. I don't think there is anyone in any country around the world who operates at the scale that you do. Yeah, and I'm not saying number one or larger. In terms of there is somebody else, I don't even know who else could even be a comparable. That was my point. And because we live in a world where people are always looking to pattern match. They're looking at in China, this exists in the US, this exists. And they're trying to fit an Indian company. So does this act as a barrier when you're trying to explain to someone that we are the largest at what we do from India and there is no one else? Some people ask you how come this is? We are a bit first principles oriented. We haven't done this because there was a large market. We haven't done this because there wasn't. The only jurors did not exist when we started. But just first principles oriented. So when you're first principles oriented, sometimes you end up doing things which haven't been done before. But let me explain to you in a nutshell, the problem of the insurance industry. A customer pays a premium. At that time, a distributor is paid. And at that time, a insurance company receives a premium. So both of these are right now in the positive. Then a customer has a claim. When he has a claim, the customer is in the positive and the insurance company is a negative. So in the beginning, the customer is in the negative. So it's a negative decision for the customer upfront. There's no upfront benefit that the customer receives. There is no upfront cost for the insurance company except for the distribution really. And creating a product and all that stuff doesn't cost so much. And for the distributor, he also gets paid. So very lopsided interests. The distributor and the insurance company both wake money upfront. And the customer loses money. Hopefully in the future, the customer has the potential of making a lot of money. As they call it, one is to 100 times money. So he may have paid one rupee and he may make 100 rupees. At that time, the company will lose 100 rupees. So extremely lopsided interests. If you think about it, the best thing for the insurance company is I collect premium from people and I never pay claims. The best thing for the customer is he pays a premium where he's 100% sure he's going to claim. Right? So totally conflicted interests. Now in this situation, a good long term intermediary will be one who gets the right, basically you're selling a promise and that promise better be right on the right terms or the right understanding. So you have to have very good disclosure from the customer and you have to have very good disclosure from the supplier. The reason I've had to explain this is the way profits get made in the insurance industry and I have met hundreds of decision makers not just in India across the world. Is they try to make the profit on Devan itself guaranteed? We have this concept of VNB which is what is the profit you have made on your business? What is the profit potential? So business may run 30 years but you've calculated what's VNB? It's basically the value of the policy that you have sold. So we have this habit of almost calculating our profitability because of actualities because of various things on sort of day one itself. And what that lends itself to is selling products where you can almost know you've made money on day one. How does that happen? If you think about the insurance industry, how do that happen? You sell a product where whatever you've paid to the distributor is taken from the customer. What a savings product, mostly. Right? If the customer cancels this, there will be surrender charges etc etc etc. So you will almost always make money. So there is almost no risk. Now you're getting to the game of risk. Most parts of the industry would not even want to go to the side of risk because health insurance and life insurance actually claims that it to be paid. And there the conflict starts coming between. So the industry somewhere for the smartest people in the industry and talking about big CEOs, people who've run the industry for 20 years, 30 years, they would almost say, let's not waste time. Let's we know how money is paid. Let's make money. You know, let this kid shout around and waste his time and one day he will die because essentially he's trying the impossible. Who's this kid? Let's say, let's say me. Okay? I believe this gothic card exists forever. You have to solve for this. Right? You have to educate the customer. You mean that this conflict will always, oh, you're talking about the conflict where they do not want to confront risk. I'm saying, I'm not talking about any one individual in general, the industry. Right? And time teaches you things that don't work and things that work. Right? So it's a very misunderstood industry. And risk creates claims and you don't want to sell products which have lots of claims. And you don't want to sell products where there's a chance that claims can be very high because you somehow misunderstood the customer. It's a very hard thing for me to understand, okay, this is Rohan in front of me. There are 100 Rohans. Their chance of claiming is so much I have to promise him lifelong renewability on health. I don't know what diseases are going to appear. What patterns is a complex subject? Right? And then basis that my profitability will determine very complicated subject. So it's not for the faint-handed, far more complicated than lending. In lending, we all worry about not giving loans to people who will not repay. But insurance that thinking of somehow getting a fraudulent customer is not that deep as an industry. You know, you would have interviewed hundreds of people in the industry. Every time you talk about somebody about lending, the biggest topic would be collections and credit quality. I don't know if you would interact with insurance people if you get the same concept. That the biggest concept in the insurance industry is actually disclosure and claims. I think you would get things like let's simplify the product, let's somehow get it sold, let's somehow attach the product, let's get it embedded insurance. You would have heard a lot of these words. So what you're essentially saying is that the industry largely focuses on growth and selling more rather than the profile of customers and profitability. The way to make money in insurance, right? Actually, we also must make money, so that's great. What some are trying to do is say, what is right for the consumer? Can we actually educate at the very heart of him? Because in this industry, the surprising thing is at least in the short term, the more you educate the customer, actually works against you in the short term. Because why is that? Because the savings products, if you educate the customer too much, they will not get charges, etc, etc. They will not buy that. They may not buy. I remember long, long ago, one day, somebody from one large company came to me and said, we want to hold a savings insurance day where we will put all the plans out there and explain every part of it so that there's a lot of take-up of consumers. I hold it by hands and all of them don't do this. You'll actually be destroying the industry. So education sometimes can work against sales, at least in the short term, right? Selling damage is not easy. Telling somebody, your family will get paid once you are dead. And that goes against the very Indian and Asian ethos of not wanting to confront that you may be there. Or, why should I pay someone money when I'm not getting anything in return? Exactly. These are hard problems to solve. So I sometimes say that in the insurance industry, sometimes the consumer is his own biggest enemy. And thus education is your biggest friend. And thus education is the biggest bet. Educate a lot. But at the same time, you don't allow customers to miscommunicate to you. You don't allow fraudsters. It's a very tough thing. You have 2%-3% fraudsters. We've spent what? About 25 minutes or so talking. Just think of one thing. I've had a spent 18 minutes of that talking about risk and education. You interact with people at the insurance industry and tell me when you find that. Why is that? Let me take you upon that, right? Because you're talking about it. Because you asked me why is policy bizarre unique? No, I get that. I'm saying that. That's the reason. Would it not stand to reason that for an insurance company, it's even more important to understand? I'll explain. See, it's a low trust category. In this, what you actually want is a high fidelity, high trust product. People very loosely say we should increase confidence. Now, what is increasing confidence? Especially when the customer is also there. Let's say 5% of customers are out there to get the one is 200 benefit. Now if 5% of customers, let's say even 1% of customers take the one is 200 benefit. Your entire collections are wiped out, obviously. Because if 1% takes 100%, and it's 1% of customers, so 1% fraudsters can destroy this industry. I would even go to the saying even in lending 1% fraudsters, we work with 5% NPA. The lending industry is okay to work with 5% NPA. The insurance industry cannot work with 5% fraudsters. Even 1% fraudsters can destroy the industry. You have to be that precise in catching it. That's a very hard thing to do. For us and for the insurance industry. And by view is, I have seen very few focus on it or be worried about it as much as they need to be. But that's my question. Why? Why do you think so? Let me share one more thing with you. Actually, one very large insurance company CEO said it in a very good way. He was a very nice person. He said, by the time the claims of my life insurance policies, I would be the CEO. No, I was just about to say that it's not my problem. Yeah. Now, please don't take that wrongly. Yeah, I get it. But something is going to happen today. But what matters is what sales I get. The claims will probably come at a later stage. So it's misaligned incentives. Short. I wouldn't go there. I wouldn't go there. But like, how would we really solve it, right? If something, the cost is paid 10 years or not. First I change this, you know, there is time lags at who would stop at making money? Neither would I. Right. So I'm not saying that we are holding it down. It's just I'm troubled by something which is so obvious that I don't find as many people troubled by. That's all. That's all one is. And what is policy was doing to. So we had a four hour day. Where we ran out of time. Where all we did was we talked to. We explained what we are doing to control fraud. It's really that simple. Okay, I'll give you an example of what kind of fraud actually happens in the insurance industry. You want basic, basic, you get surprised. So yesterday somebody told me somebody was trying to buy a policy for someone. And they actually had a video. And in the video, there was a person who was dead. And you could tell the person was dead. He was propped up against the car. That's the basic level of frauds people try. And every time I'll give you another example. We started selling savings products. People started paying 3000 rupees premium per month at doing frauds. Now we've managed to control everything up to 5000 rupees. Somebody started coming and paying 8000 rupees. So these are organized fraud groups. There is no way to stop them entirely. The whole idea is you have to keep moving one step ahead of the game and make sure your particular channel is harder to break than others. So to be clear, yes, yes, and we spend a huge amount of time on that. Whether it's through technology, whether it's through people, whether it's through verifiable processes, whether it's through multiple checks, it's very simple things, right? The person who bought the policy, their voice is consistent because we usually sell a policy over health or life policy over six, seven periods. Somebody would get very excited if people started buying instantly. We get very worried. So sudden grease in conversion rates in our particular city is a warning signal for us. So if I suddenly in Bhuvani get where I get 50 visitors, I suddenly get eight sales. It's a big, big alarm bell for me. You appreciate right? Because that means something is happening. Sorry. I have to quickly. I must interrupt you here to just clarify one thing. The Bazaar is a platform and the common understanding of how the platform operates is that people come to policy bazaar and they become leads which you pass on to insurance companies. So to a lay person, it does not look like why are you doing this fraud analysis because isn't that the job of the insurance company? So it looks like you are doing. No, no, no, no, you both look. Anybody who interacts with the consumer is the first line of defense against fraud. If anybody believes that is not the case and the person who is interacting with the consumer is a dumb, you know, it's just basically a dumb terminal. I think it's, I think it's very, very shallow understanding. Right? But that's obvious, right? Who else will defend? You are interacting with me. You can look me in the eye right now. You can tell whether there is, you know, we all have those pattern matching and various things in our own brains filtered over years. We can tell whether somebody is passionate, whether somebody is, there's a lot of stuff we can do. We are the first line of defense. When we meet somebody, we can tell what kind of person they are. And you do this in order to make sure that the people who are buying through policy bazaar are genuine. Let me tell you why I selfishly do it. My company is horizon and me being the largest individual shareholder of this company is longer than the company, than the person who's buying the policy. We may have a five year, 10 year horizon. I probably have a 20 year horizon. So I want policy without a 20 year from now also. If I don't differentiate my platform versus other channels on quality, it's bad for me. I'm not even worried about the, so if I don't make profits for my partners, that cannot be a good thing for me. Long term. Today, I can make money. I tell my partners, making money from you today is one piece of the activity, but that's not the main part. The main part is that I'm going to be making money from you 20 years from now or not. And that gives me strength. Right? Let me kind of, if there was one thing I could do, I would set up a reinsurance company. But what do they tell you about me? That I think for risk, we have an understanding of risk, which is now deep enough that we want to embed ourselves deeper into that and make calls on our books, which we don't understand the rest of the market as well. Because I believe, I believe today, lots of channels do not focus as much on this area. And the thinking that the channel is not responsible, see, till late, even from an extent the regulation is still late, used to say the channel cannot be penalized for claims. Right? That's my question to you. My point is, it logically doesn't seem right to me, logically, logically thinking. How can the person who's interacting with the consumer not be responsible for the quality of the customers? In the offline world, that would be equivalent of saying the broker who sold a policy should not be held this month. We don't say that. Yeah, but the point is, come on. I get it. But just to clarify, you have a point about wanting to set up a reinsurance, reinsurance being essentially the place where insurers go and insure their own. It is the one that finally carries the biggest risks. Right? So if you have a life insurance policy, 70 to 90% of the risk lies with reinsurance. And you need reinsurance capacity to be able to write a lot of business and reinsurance of sort of paid premium by the insurers. By the insurers, yeah. So eventually, everybody at some level is a distributor and the reinsurers will have bigger reinsurers behind them. So my point is, because we understand the our risk, quite our risk, quite well, not the market risk, we believe there's a possibility there that reinsurers should start differentiating prices and features for those products. And I also believe a lot of innovation can happen at the process end, which if a reinsurer had better visibility on, they could price better. And that's a good thing for the market. It will, it is actually a change which will make the market grow. But if you notice, I have not yet focused on simplification of products, speed of products, because you know what? That in many cases opens up to, see, to sell insurance, you have to be able to marry a couple of things. You have to not miss sell. And especially as you go to less wealthy people, right? You should be not allowed to miss sell even more because they don't have the ability to understand, you know, richer people can understand better or more financially well off people can understand hopefully better. So that's that's one part. So if you stop miss selling, you have to make sure the disclosure is very high level because without disclosure, you'll get hammered again, the same thing, the weaker you go into society, the level of disclosure increases, the problem of disclosure increases because the person is more and more desperate. Remember this guy's giving you 20,000 rupees, 2000 rupees, 200 rupees. He wants it back here. And if he can get 100 times back, he's desperate to get it back. So he's going to try, he's going to try stuff, right? And you got to protect yourself against it because you can't allow him to try stuff, right? And as a point is, the lower in the segment, you go, this is a part that's not very well understood by people. But actually, the lower you go into the segments, this problem tends to become more amplified, more amplified problem. And so people talking about what happened with pyramid term time, they're not understanding the real issue, right? Let me give you a very, okay, the third thing is cost of delivery. Now remember, I came to that last because that you can, you can only solve for that and you solve the other two because the cost of distribution and insurance is about over the lifetime of the policy on average is about 4, 5 percent. But the cost of claims is 75, 80 percent over the lifetime of the policy, right? So that's the problem we want to solve, not the 4, 5 percent, right? Now, people point out towards various kind of things. Somebody tells me there's a company called Bema that sells one rupee policies. I'm not going to comment on any one company, but the point is, all over the world, look at all these policies, all these embedded policies, etc, etc. Just calculate what is the actual claim payout with the customer from all of them combined across the world. I can give you the answer about 10 percent. Your point being that my point being then either help to the consumer, they are only helpful to the person, the product creator, the guy who has the embedded platform. Like if it's an Ali Baba or somebody, they would probably make money. They sure an ideal number claims ratio for a product. For me, a good claims ratio in a product is about 70 percent because that tells you that, okay, individually, the risk is too much for me. So I should have some consolidation of risk between hundreds of people. And yes, they should have something left for themselves because otherwise why would they consolidate for me if there was no, if the claims ratio was 105 percent, why would I do it? So 70 percent means out of every 100 rupees of premium collected roughly between 70 to 90 percent should be paid. The cost of distribution rate between 5 to 20 percent and there's an administration cost and there's some revenue you make. All right. So if I kind of see that from a simplistic, if the claims ratio is 70 to 90 percent. So that means from a profit margin, I mean, if I were to use that word, it's like 10 to 30 is your profit. It's a little different from that. I know, I know. Because there is investment in CUM in India, you have 8 percent investment in CUM and a long-term policy, please understand. And life in Jorah is about 30 year policy of collecting premiums 30 years and you're paying the claim much later. I was simplifying it. Yeah. And in a simple manner, my view is 70 to 90 percent of the value of the money should be derived by the consumer. It can never be 100 percent because then why would anybody do business? Okay. All right. Switching gears to policy bizarre. You were one of the earliest proponents of doing distribution via people calling up from a call center. It was, I think, unfashionable in the early days, then a lot of people, exactly, right? Like in a state that way, and like, I'm sure you have got multiple calls from people or like investors asking, isn't it more efficient to do it online via apps, et cetera, et cetera? So first question is like, how many people do you have in your call center today? And the second, of course, related is like, how is, how is your thing? We have about 5,000 people in the call center. We have about 1,000 people who are available physically across the country to meet people. And yeah, so as you're, as you're thinking on having your own call centers, such large call centers, ever changed? No. And I'm very grateful we went down this route. It was not a natural thing for me because before this, I had never uncalled centers. We had one partner who was a specialist at running call centers. And for whatever reason, he decided to exit very early. And I do not feel good about the fact that exit happened so early, but he exited up a company about after about five years of it being set up. And but I think a lot of credit to him. This was a niche, a niche, a lot of credit to him for having made us think in this manner. At that time, we hadn't thought too deep about why call center, etc, etc. We just did it because he was a specialist in call centers. So he set it up naturally. And today with the benefit of hindsight, how do I, I'm just grateful that happened. See, I'm asking this because it's counter-induitive for most people. I'll explain. They think it's out there. Let us say, let us say we make 100 rupees in revenue. The cost of my call center is about 20 rupees of that revenue. That's the reality. Anybody can, it's a public company. Broadly, maybe 2019, don't hang me for that, but it's in that range. It's about one-fifth of my revenue. If I did not have my contact center, I'm talking again about health and life. So again, people are very confused. Like me, please understand, till 2008, I did not understand the health and life business. Today, I'm the largest seller of health and term in this country, the largest by far in a way. I don't think there's anybody who's even one-tenth of us. So that's a very big thing for some people like India. I'm talking about online, offline, everything. And at that time, I did not even know what health and children's life in children's world. And I think most people are in that mindset, whether they are investors or whether they are market participants, most people are in that zone that they actually don't understand it. They think it is a bit like motor insurance. In a way like Sanjeev, that motor insurance comparison, it should do well. That's exactly what policy was. And many people think of us still as that. That's what my supermarket is. So even if you look at our international investors, there are many times think of us as that. Right? Money supermarket is a UK. It's a UK base. That's what I would say is the biggest platform for motor insurance in the world. We might be as big or bigger now. Let's leave that aside. So I think the difficulty there is a very standard product, very well understood product, and price is pretty much the only differentiator. People don't understand that in health and life, when people say I want a simple product, that's one of the consumers want. Because the consumer wants what's special for me. That's the reality. And that's the consumers need to understand the different plans they engage. They take two weeks to six weeks to purchase. There's a whole cycle there. And for health and life, my revenue would be between one fourth to one third if I did not have the call center. So now let's come to the mathematics of this. Right? For 20% extra cost. I am getting 70% extra revenue. Why? Right? So my, no, let's get to maths. So my return is 3.5 x on my investment. So it's and I'm not even getting to NPV yet. I'm only talking about first year revenue. For having the contact center, my return on investment is 3.5 x. You saw that investment. I move on. The second thing is because of this, my sales are triple, which gives me a lot of leeway with partners. They, they find value in us because of that. The last thing, which I did not have a clue about when we started, please now appreciate I have voice analytics data, not just dynamic of today, but static for the last 15 years, because we've been recording conversations for the last 15 years, each and every conversation is recorded. And we have claims data for the last 15 years. You realize the value of this? Having each words spoken by the consumers and by our people and it's because technology is a world now and having its linkages to claims and understanding that and thus being able to pick out for the future. It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a crazy amount of information in a, in a business which is totally dependent on information. Right? So not having that. You come as a customer. Are you talking about cataract? Are you talking about diabetes? Are you talking about claims? So I'll give you a very simple answer here. We have one particular analysis. I'm talking about a very superficial level now and this may not even be true because I'm probably confused. So let me say what I'm saying may not be true. Okay? But if a person in motor insurance is the most standard product talks about claims and one guy does not talk about the claims experience. The actual claims ratios are about 30% apart. Are you realize the power of having that ability to talk? Just talk. Talk to me. Sorry about that. Tell me a customer speaking about claims. Yeah. Yeah. So what is the correlation there like, you know, someone who speaks versus someone who doesn't speak. So could be wrong information. I'm clarifying so that nobody in the market kind of suits me for this. Yeah. But about a 30% delta. So that is huge, right? It is, it is, okay, so let me put it this way. I get paid 13%. This is 30%. So this is two and a half times what I get paid. So you know, we're talking about just a single thing. I got it. So the call center over 15 years has provided with a wealth of analog information. It has provided me with three times more sales than I would have otherwise got. It has provided me a wealth of data. And it's analog information because digital information is there is no way for you to someone check something, someone write something, you know, in an app. No, I also track that. I also track that. But there is this also, right? And it is because technology is evolving now that everything is captureable. I'll give you a very simple example. The person who goes for the medicals, is it the same voice as the person who did the call. We're now not just doing calls bus. You know, we are now physically meeting people. We have video conversations, roughly 20% of us have a video conversations. Are you running a lot of AI in our huge amount here? Huge amount. I would say it is AI with impact and with action. There's no point talking about the AI. The point is it's having impact. And that is why we're talking about reinsurance and insurance and risk. And you know, what we can do on that front. So I think, yeah, a lot of things, we're getting to a scale where it's starting to make sense for us. And I think without that communication. So I would say, okay, who else has built, let us say, online sales in health and life, without conversations, nobody. Now, the second largest, I will not even name them, but the second largest player in the market is building it primarily through video conversations. They're almost a party that nobody's heard of, but they are almost all their sales are through video conversations. And very large platforms or very large companies with lots and lots of customers are not able to build it because that engagement is not there. But that's the reality. You need it in this market because, yeah, it's required. That's it. I'll quickly switch to the sports aspect. A lot of people say they are into sports and we are really into sports. What's the amount of like, we talked about the fact that you are a runner. I know you're a triathlete. What is the amount of training that you typically do these days and in what sports? So I think roughly about 12 and a half, 13 hours a week on endurance sports, mostly running, cycling and swimming. But that's not because I have any goals or anything. It's just a habit. It's become a habit. And if I don't do it, I don't feel good about it. You did have some, I think, a couple of years ago, if I'm not mistaken, didn't you start doing something? What was it like swimming? I became the master's national champion in swimming. I'm quite good in cycling. I'm okay in running. Running was what I started with as a kid. As a family, my kids also participate. We win a few triathlon relays and all that stuff. But you train your kids as well. How old are your kids? So I'll tell you what I wanted to share with you is what I shared with my kids. I said, look. You are first a soul. And the first externality you have is your body. Then you have your clothes. And then you have a house on a car. So let's never go the other way round or starting to put car in house before your body. That's a fascinating thing. Or your clothes before your body. Because those are things you can change more easily. And they are actually external to you. They're never yours. You will start. One day you will leave the body also. But chances are it will stay with you much longer than anything else. So solve that much before you solve for the car and the house. Because it will get a little bit of a hard time. I gave my son this all the time. I said, and guys don't get me wrong. Everybody is everybody. But I told him, okay, if you had somebody getting off a Rolls Royce, but they were this really unfaithed, lousy looking person or you had somebody getting off a Maruti, but they were really Millen Soman. Which one would you prefer to be? It's obvious. Millen Soman getting out of a Maruti is according to me far, far more preferable than somebody really unhealthy getting off a Rolls Royce. I think we should be clear in our priorities. Once you have that priority sorted, sorted. It means the most important thing besides improving your soul and your character, improving your body is the most important thing in life. How old are your kids? 21 and 19. And you train them. I have a friend. I'm not allowed to train them. I've heard that you're competitive with them. I compete with them. I compete with them. And I keep discovering things about them. So you know, if we are racing, they are triathletes as well. So let's say in swimming, my daughter is faster than me. But whenever we have a race, she will actually beat me. She will compete and beat and win. What I noticed about my son was he won't beat me. He'll just stay. But if he gets a much more competitive swimmer than me, then he'll compete and beat me. So he's got that little, you know, he's considered the guy who's not. But he's got that deep respect somewhere. And he, I once asked him that, you know, why didn't you overtake me? Because we were doing a 10k and I knew he could and he did not. And he used a wrong word. I don't know whether he said I'm not an asshole. Basically, he says, I'm not going to do that. So it's just, you know, I'm nothing to prove by beating you. So and he said, I want to make you feel good. Whatever, I'm just running along with you. So I'm grateful, yeah, for both the kids and I'm grateful that they at least do some amount of fitness. So. Do you see a difference in the way? Yes, she's the CEO behaves. Oh, sorry. Yes, she's the co founder and you chairman now. Yeah. Chairman of the board. This are the CEO behaves versus yes, she's the father. No, they exactly the same. Exactly the same. I promise you, they exactly the same. So I deal with things exactly the same for both. What is that? If you were to kind of reduce it. And I like. I like. I like people to understand the depth of things. The fundamental reason why they are doing stuff like today we were doing a review and somebody was trying to explain to me, this is our profit. I said, I'm not even interested in that. I really want to understand why you're doing it. And yes, we will come to the metrics, but let's get the reason right first and let's not be afraid of hard decisions. Let's not be afraid of anything. But let's do it all for the right reasons and let's not be pretending to anybody else. Right. So let's have no pretenses. Let's be real. Corby, fundamentally strong. I find it odd when people don't work with their potential, but I have found it in myself to live with it. You know, whether it was my sister, whether it was my mother, whether it was my wife, many of times they leave a lot of potential on the table and so do I find with a lot of my colleagues. They just leave a lot of potential on the table and don't work to potential. I've just come to in life, everybody will not be the same. So it pains me. It used to pain me a lot more. Now also it pains me. But I say, let's just keep the peace. What do you tell people when it comes to thinking about their potential? The potential is also when we talk about a company. You know, you could be, you grow at a certain, so I'll put it this way. When you are doing well is when you're actually not doing well and then you're not doing well is actually when you're doing well. Because for most times when we are under pressure and not doing great, we tend to push ourselves. So suppose, suppose in a month, our growth is zero. We would have been working extra hard at trying to find that 2% of growth somehow. Suppose in a month our growth is 70% or 80%. We'd be so happy about it. Let me just leave 5% here and there. That's the reality. And it's about bringing that reality to people that I think Sanji was very good at it. Because I remember all our board meetings with him. Whenever we were excited and happy, he would send us back subdued. And whenever we were sad and we were unhappy with our performance, he would send us back enthused. So, but yeah, that's what I get to like, when I speak with Sarabhi, also it's the same. Like I always tell him that listen, the state you got the business in implies a certain level of growth and profitability anyway. So the 1000-grow profit is almost a given and he knocks me back. He says, yeah, yeah, it's a given for sure. But the point is that is true. It is what you do beyond that really is a differentiator because that additional amount just comes every quarter month, all you have to do is grow 30%. Now, yeah, that's a challenge. But because of renewal growth and all that stuff. So I'm just talking financials for a moment. But there are certain things that I just set in stone. You know, they're just motions happening, right? And getting excited about those things is no value. That's just NPV showing up, which was actually past revenue. Exactly. I mean, my analogy would have been that if you're enjoying something today, it's probably because of the hard work that you put in in the past. So what are you doing today to create something in the future? Yeah, and there's a lot we're doing. But it's very hard to point fingers at, look, this is, so the physical piece that we set up is all now. I think the biggest thing that we've done in the last two years is actually customer support. You know, what we are hearing is we're now getting a windfall of consumers. Nothing's changed. Nothing's changed. There's no sudden market turn, right? Why is it happening? I'm almost feeling like it's that layer of goodwill that has been built, where our communication has been at the point of claim we will help you. At the point of claim, we will help you. And that becoming real, which is entirely service credit. We did not have that before we joined. The whole physical channel being built out where we are going and meeting customers to sell to them. This is the roughly 1000 people. There's the roughly 1000 people. That's not so. So what is this organization? There's 1000 people. What's the responsibility? Sell. Sell. See, okay. And also you said customer support. Let me explain. Let me explain. If a customer comes to you for health or life, why does he come to you? I have done the talking to our guys and figuring out when they come to you. They mostly come when there's a life event that's happened. Either some friend or family has just died or been to hospital, big bill. They've seen the situation. Something has influenced them. Otherwise nobody doesn't come to anybody's mind that policy bizarre was in the background telling them you should have health and joy as you tell. So when this event happens, they say, yeah, that guy was saying something. So let me go to policy without that. Specifically, we have a huge amount of direct traffic. There is questions comes. I'm spending 20,000 rupees. Will these guys actually pay the claim or not? You know, it's not. It doesn't matter whether it's 20,000 right? It's the insurance company. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's a very important thing. Many times you will believe yes, it's the insurance company. But and this is something that is not very well understood all over the world помощью. But actually the client is also the first client of defense against lack of payment of claims. The distributor because he's the interface. So he, he, first of all, he has no interest in not paying the claim because he would like his land to get paid plus he has knowledge about the industry. So he can navigate better. He can, he or she can has relationships with the insurer. And if you have a profitable pool of business with the insurer, your ability to have a fair conversation and get the claim paid is extremely high. We have seen a lot of proof where a claim is denied, but it's eventually paid when we intervene. It's very, very large numbers. No, I'm not talking anecdotally about one case. Systematically, that's the case. And almost 10 to 15% higher claim settlement because of that, which is pretty much the gap. Like the gap is about 10 to 15%. So I can hand on the heart and say we would fight the corner for a consumer like crazy where we knew there was a gentleman claim. Equally, when we from our, we also look at our own data and try to figure out even post facto if the customer was in any way misguiding and we find lots and lots of stuff. And we report that to the insurance company almost instantaneously. So if you are an honest customer who's declaring fairly with us, you can pretty much rest assured that we will make sure that the insurance company and our partner is fair to you at the point of claim. If you've been dishonest in purchasing the policy, you should be very worried if you work to us. So what are you doing is trying to incentivize both sides of your platform, better customers and better insuring part, insurers and partners. Absolutely. And playing a active role in the middle in dispute resolution effectively. Both with information capture, we're running programs that have not been done anywhere in the world here. You're running programs like Bhima Samadhan. You know what that program is? We go on live television or something insurance company us and 20 customers who's claims have been rejected. They come on the platform and they talk to each other. And in that 60% of claims get settled on the spot. Right? We have programs at the website and the company where see when will a customer come to us, only when the claim is rejected. Otherwise, why will a customer come to us? The claim is happening smoothly, where does he need to come to us? Right? And it's at that point that you come in. That's when the customer needs your help the most. In some of your early interviews, you've talked about curiosity and confusion being very important. I think you were asked about confidence and clarity. And I think you added and say it's very important to be curious. And that you're on certain amount of confusion that you had about your identity, which got clarified over a period of wise curiosity. So important for you. Curiosity is a necessity for first principle thinking. Otherwise, you will always be looking at so and so did this. So I should do this. They're doing better than matching with our understanding and depth. So I just don't do that. I will not follow. Usually I would not just follow unless I have a lot of clarity in my mind. And when I do that, I'll do that openly. Like I'll give you an example. We're running the corporate business. I don't have the ability to be dishonest. Corporate business implying you selling to companies. So when people ask me, what's your plan for this business? I tell them very clearly we are learning. We don't know. We think there's a very big market. We think there's a scope for technology. We think there's a scope for a good distributor. We think there is something here, but we do not know for a public company CEO. To be saying, I do not know. It's a very big thing. And it's been two and a half years that we've been to one and a half years that we've been running that business. And I'm still saying that. But the most important thing is my employees who are looking for clarity, career clarity, I'm saying the same thing to them also. Right. So there's confusion. When there's confusion, you have to accept it. That yes, there is confusion. We're not sure. But there is no. There's no harm carrying on in that situation. But you need to know because when you're driving a car, when you don't know where you are, you drive slowly, you drive cautiously. You don't drive at full throttle in that situation. Right. And I think that is where genuine honesty becomes a very big trait. So I have some of the senior management telling me that why don't you just say you're committed to this business because even today when I'm talking to you, some of them will come back to me and say, yeah, what are you? You went on media and said you're not committed to the business. I said, I cannot say something I don't believe in. Right. And I said, that is my strength. That's my weakness. You know, we are, let's say honest to a fault. But that's also a strength. If I say something to you, the thing I hate the most is when people are, let's say guessing whether you're speaking the truth or not. And to me, that's the worst thing a person can do to me. As a human being because that is something I hate the most. I mean, that aligns with policy bazaar and his job of trying to detect who's telling the truth. Yeah. I mean, from a, so as a leader, do you have any tips on how you identify and groom potential leaders? You spoke about future potential. Same thing, yeah, I like to see truthfulness. I like to see. So the one trait that we classify in policy bazaar is an ayota of selflessness. And both those words are very carefully used. We don't expect you to be selfless all the time. You have to be selfish to survive also and to succeed. And I want people to be smart and selfish also. But at times you shouldn't be a person who doesn't have the ability to be selfless. And I just want to have the ability at all. I can only think myself. You know, there's some people who will create a 100 rupee loss for the company for one rupee of their own benefit. Now, that is something we cannot have. And I know it sounds weird, but that happens all the time in the corporate world, right? And in any part of the world, right? So we spot that ayota of selflessness somehow and over over over a lifetime, you start developing a pattern, a matching on that. When people come into the organization who don't match that profile, very quickly, that gets like they stand out like a sore thumb in the organization. And the organization is very harsh on them very, very rapidly. It's almost like a body turning on a foreign agent that it's almost like HR doesn't need to get involved. Those people know they are, they are outsiders here. And it gets caught up in everything. And we are extremely transparent to the organization. So people almost start calling it out. And we have seen small, small things like, you know, we don't have anything like what time you come into office, what time you don't. But on a day that there's a problem and on the day when you also have a personal commitment, let's say, and depends, right? If your kid is on, well, that's a different issue. But if you're going to see a football match and you've bought a ticket for 50,000 rupees, let's just say, are you able to walk off from that ticket because you have something serious that you need to solve? Right? We look for those kind of things. And, and we find them. And honestly, the 50,000 rupees doesn't matter in the long term. So we basically look for silly decision making that sometimes people do. And if you're a silly decision maker, you won't last it. It's, it's very simple. Culture is obviously very important for you. How have you as a founder? I like to try to build and evolve your culture. So I like to explain to people that the biggest traits for success at policy without long term are going to be patients and trust. Either you trust us or you don't trust us. If you trust us, be patient. At times, it may appear we're not being fair to you. But you show me cases where we have not been fair to people for, let's say, five years, seven years. Show me cases. Look around the organization. See people. See how they have done. And see if we have been unfair to people over a medium to long term period. Sometimes in the short term, life is never going to be 100% fair. We may not be able to identify everybody. We may not be able to be fair to everyone in the short term. That's why I say before five years, we consider you a new journey. Before five years are over. So be patient. What is your average redemption? Because in the world that we live in today, it's very rare for people to say I will work for five years in an organization. So medium to senior management. Five years, we consider the new journey. So Sarabhiz now being about three years, he's new in the system. Just like, obviously he's he's gotten involved very rapidly. But that's the that's the thinking. So many people will stand up and say, yeah, I'm new to the company. And that's up to about five years. So I'm just giving you the number, the number for us, the cutoff point is about five years. We have more than 100 people who are 10 years old. Please appreciate in the entire management team at that 10, they may be 150 people. 10 years ago, like talking about 2013. So maybe 200 people. So of them, at least half of them are still here. And yeah, we take, we take great pride that those 100 do well. And the fact that others who are patient eventually do well. Still sticking to culture. I'm trying to distill policy buzzards, success, longevity down to elements of its culture. You talked about honesty to a fault. You talked about IOTA selflessness. And now you talked about patience and trust. Is there any other value which is very we work with urgency? So see, while we are patient, I was just about the same time we work with urgency. So work with urgency, work with purpose, be. So how, I mean, how does an employee reconcile patients and urgency at the same, like, yeah, so there we are being a being of itself is a company. We're saying be urgent with your work, be patient for the rewards. And maybe we're being selfish, right? But in a way, we know our truth. We're also being honest and telling you upfront that there is no way that. So give an example, right? One guy pretty much after the IPO came here and said, what's in it for me for the future? I said, why is this I can get one crore outside? Out here, my compensation is 65 lakhs. It doesn't add up. I said, how much have you made in the last seven years that you've been here? So he said, yeah, I've made about 20 crore rupees. I said, could you have made that like you could have, but in general, were you expecting to make that when you joined here? He said, no, what is it, but that's done. So I said, what makes you think that my colors will suddenly change? Or our colors will suddenly change that we will stop all next for you to make money. He, he basically, he's a nice guy, but he didn't have trust. And he didn't have patience. So he moved on. Got him joined a corporate. I can promise you five years from now, he'll repent that decision. And I'm not being harsh to him or bad to him. It's just, I just feel bad. I'm not saying he could have continued here forever. But all I'm saying is, according to it was a terrible decision, which I feel bad about. Bad about not whether hurt the company in any way, but because it's going to end up hurting him. Because life is long and you know, there's another 15 years of fun ahead. And and of course, we will grow and we will grow in value and employees will make lots again when they add value. But it'll be when they add value, it can't be without adding value. And that's where the new ESOP thing that we are going to plan is going to be, you know, market price linked and all that stuff. So that from here onwards, as you add value, you derive a lot of, there's no problem. Nobody's saying that if the company value, just saying over the next five years, let's say, let's say triples. Nobody's saying management can't have 10% of it. Of the growth nobody's saying that. But the point is it can't be that the value would not grow and management will take 10% that also can't be. That's also stupidity. So I think as long as somebody's going to have a honest conversation in a line, we're happy to create. But sometimes people don't have the patience because they say it didn't happen today. Those people usually tend to be their own enemies. What is it that you feel you add most value to policy, Basash? I think this piece that we spoke about, by the way, I do work quite a bit. So there's a lot of operational stuff I do. Which of course I meant, but but but real value is this keeping the company on a straight forward. See, I'll put it very simply. What did I feel bad about after I put the first six months because people were basically second guessing us saying what they are saying is not true. That to me is the worst state I can be in. So I think what the. What do you want? What a different public company and private company in a public company, private company investors have a lot of interaction with the company in a public company. You probably need to trust. Nobody needs to second guess us. That's the biggest thing in a way like nobody needs to second guess in for each. And the company which you always need to second guess. Because you don't need to second guess. That's the most important thing. And till I'm there, that will stay the thing. You will never need to second guess the company. And lot of fundamental reasons why companies get destroyed culture, etc. etc. Will not happen because I will become uncomfortable that with that situation much faster than the company can be allowed to become uncomfortable with it. So hard decisions, etc. etc. will all get taken. Whenever they are necessary. I think that's the value I bring. And that's not very important. Eventually we have to survive 20 years. But he's a company. And we have a very good team. I'm not the only one who is building the company. Neither am I the only guy with the equity in the company. So we have hundreds of people with equity and alignment in the company. And I think it's the hard work of everybody and the alignment of everybody that deliver it. But I've been made up of the wide role is that. How do you learn new things today? I'm actually not very good at learning new things. I don't really go out seeking new things. And many people don't see that because they think we do see me doing the variety of things. But I've been a runner since I was 80 years old. It's not a new thing that I picked up. Okay. Yeah. How do you how do you teach and mentor people with the organization? See people in the organization come up with lots of ideas, lots of thought processes. And it's about our framework and aligning people on that framework that how will we evaluate? How will we look at things? How will we build businesses? What's our ethos? Those are the things that we really focus on then keeping then eventually watching the numbers also. It can't be just strategy. See having a good strategy is okay. But every once in a while you need to see the numbers also. So then holding people honest to the numbers. That's that's basically senior management role here. What else does senior management do? And you know culturally making sure things are not going off. People's interest are not misaligned, etc. Those are the things that you spend time on. I'm sure you've interviewed hundreds, possibly thousands of people from the time that you started policy bazaar. Not really, but okay. Let's let's let's say dozens or possibly at least 100. What do you have great open-ended questions that you ask people? No. What are your conversations? They're busy. I don't read any relationship differently. I had an arranged marriage before I went to see my wife. I already decided I'm in marriage before seeing. It was the same. I probably got rejected by five six girls. But I did not reject anyone. That's not my philosophy. I would almost not be. Is that the reason why you said that you haven't done so many interviews? Yeah. So you don't do interviews? I don't do too many interviews. I because you don't say no. I don't say no very well. And not just that. I like to think about it. Who are the senior people we've hired? They are almost all people who have known for two, three, four, five years. We are not people who, you know, we don't have for at least the people I hire. Almost nobody is without relationship. Now that's both a weakness and a strength. You can say we're not open-minded to looking at hundreds of people. Right? We've never had a headhunter. We've never had anything of that sort. Yeah, that is a weakness also. That's a strength also. So for example, when Sarabbir came in, it's not like we had a headhunter firm looking for a CEO. And then we had 20 candidates and then we narrowed down to three. And then we said, okay, these three are the ones that are board will interview and. Basically the coffee with. Sarabbir and me requesting him. Would you consider joining us? Two or a few went to I did any two. He was my senior by two years. Somebody I respect a lot then and now and even today we have difficulty because in a way he's my senior. And in a way, I'm a senior, but we don't behave that way, but point is yes. We do have those dynamics exist. Those dynamics exist, right? But. There were very specific reasons because I respected him quite a bit. But it was it was almost a tentative conversation where I didn't even know whether he would consider it. And he also said, look, if somebody else would have said it, I'm not even thought about it because I'm doing my thing. But because it's you give me a weekend. He came back after the weekend and said yes by now we had not discussed salary. We had not discussed company. By the way, we never discussed it. What was the trigger for it for you to reach out to him or to bring on board a CEO? We were going public in a few years. See, I also wanted to distance myself a bit from the organization because please understand. I'm the founder and as a founder, having worked 13, 14 years with the same team, you develop a certain amount of affection, which you cannot always act on rationally. So while you have a very good team, you know that look, however honest you are, you are leaving some gaps because of proximity because of very deep relations. So I wanted somebody to come in the middle and only somebody who might trust so much that it was it's almost like you know an extension. You have you have kids. I call it I that's how I extend to sort of be also I don't know if you've seen that movie the English movie the mom. Where this woman is sort of developing cancer and so she needs another lady whom her husband is seeing to come in and manage her children. And how that woman has to develop a relationship with the children while this person is sort of dying in a way right and it's a very, very difficult relationship. So the company and the people are like my kids, but I also know that I could be harming them by being too close to them and so they need somebody who's probably not as close and who can be a lot more rational and open minded. And also bring in new people because also our organization was not very good at bringing in new people we were getting stuck because I had a few new people and at the senior level they would get pushed off because the culture is too strong. I would use the wrong word right but sort of important to bring in somebody who was not part of that. And so and he's a he's a he's a he's a fantastic guy. I also think he's much smarter than I am, etc, etc. Although over time I realized there are a few areas where I can be quite good also. So I approached him from that perspective. He joined and I think everything has moved in the direction that it that I thought it would in a sense because the team took to him very quickly. He's brought in a lot of fresh talent so I'll give you an example right we had a very good I obviously I said about myself let's say level one level two and level two and a half but very good. But we were struggling to develop level three and level four. I think start of me coming in very because people were not moving in that direction he's he's been able to build level three and level four. He's been able to question or I had a massive aversion to physical meetings because I thought too much wrong can be communicated etc. I tried them. He tried those things right I come with a very strong bias for what's going to work and what's not going to work. He doesn't he's he's happy to try out a lot of things. So if you think about you know physical or corporate business or you know the claim support a lot of things he's tried he's extremely disciplined so way I see it as I was more like a Brazilian football team he's more like the German football team very organized very structured will succeeded everything. Maybe a little less passionate about the cause credit where it's due I think I'm very very passionate about the reason why we exist. I've heard you're being a founder as well. Yeah perhaps perhaps I think I think also as a person he doesn't get very passionate about anything he's just he's a little more professional than German team. Yeah, German team I think German team is not the team people cry about you know you said you're also involved operationally and there's also reasons where where Sarabir because I've been around for so long and they're very deep relationships all over there's a deep understanding of so when we answer a bit speak we say okay. When it's a one year thing it's almost all Sarabir when it's a five year matter it's almost all me but then we both dabble in each other's areas. So yeah there is there is regulatory side where I have we we we've all with regulation over the last 15 years so there's a very there was at least although his his understanding now is becoming almost better than mine. But there is obviously a pretty deep understanding of how that part of the world works and yeah it's just that but but increasingly those are becoming less and less and increasingly his is becoming much more. You said you're a huge fan of first principles this podcast is literally called first principles what are some of your favorite first principles are mental models when you're faced with big significant decisions that aren't easy to make. The thing about first principles is there are no models there is you you start you start you start with whatever the information is in front of you what is your right to win what are the things that will make you win in a particular activity do you have the ability to like let me talk about policy that moment we got to health in short it's very rapidly I came up with two things. This requires deep communication to the customer because the customer is not a buy easily. This is not a simple products a low trust product so it will require a lot of customer support in a way. The most critical element in this is risk so high disclosure is very very important this is something we understood back then. 2009 I remember my first meeting with Apollo Munich. My company which does not exist today with the same name yeah which became HDFC or go but was the second largest health in the country till it got sold. I remember I'm meeting with the chief and he said why should we work with you I said we would be able to get you better disclosure his view was we would not get better disclosure so I had filled up a form the day before and I showed him the form that had been filled by the agent and it said my weight was 72 kgs. I was actually 96 when was started my weight was 96 kgs so I showed him that form I said does my weight look like if you ask me my weight will I ever say 72. And so I said there is almost no disclosure the disclosure is just to make sure I don't go through a medical right but this thinking of lack of disclosure in the physical channel was very deep back then and. What was the fundamental truth here the fundamental truth is if they are recorded conversations they will almost always be better at disclosure than unrequited conversations and that was my version to physical meetings you think about it. And why do you not want to have physical meetings I still remember I still remember the conversation where we said we should have physical sales and the guy asked me why don't you have it and I said the guy does not carry a video recorder with him. And so it's an opaque conversation which I don't know nothing about so why should we do it right so I think lots of such principles on which we basically go and hang your hat you said these are so true that you know then after that it just takes energy and execution you spoke about right to and tell me a bit more about that what is right to and if you are going to be better than I don't want to use the word best but I don't know why I should not use the word but let me just say if you're going to be better than average at your quality of business and your quality of business see what are the two biggest issues and insurance customer did not understand what he was sold insurance company did not understand the risk they took on those are two biggest issues if you are better than half the industry or the average of the industry in that that's right to win. And if you are fundamentally better than them fundamentally and even if they wish they cannot be better then you have a right to win it is it is really that simple right that even if because as they call it my mother used to call it Sanjay Gehir it's not one person who's making the problem right it's so everybody will say why should I be the vaghagat Singh and suddenly start going honest business because that won't change the industry. So in that situation if you are the one who has the longevity of thought if because of fundamental reason because it's a brand you're not a person who can disappear right that's your weakness also that's you have to understand your weakness also what is your weakness here you cannot do anything wrong see an agent can although it is said that it is not allowed but cash back happens in the market I can't do it I'm not a bank being if you're buying a policy I can't give you 500 rupees back while if you buy it offline that does happen the reality is it does happen lots of advantages of physical channel has right which the digital channel does not have so digital channel has to understand it strength it strength is not in doing cashbacks because that scale if I do if I start doing cashback the reporter the regulator in two days in my license we can't start right so being under that stringent regulation being under that I of the also has a strength what is that strength the strength is you having to be honest and you're having to keep records you're having to display records customer can come and ask me seven years later 10 years later 12 years later that give me the records of my sale it was a requirement and having a physical transcript of it has been a requirement since we started so all of that is a huge advantage and we have to make that our right to win that's become the right to win and the second reason for right to win is if you are the one who's educating the whole market on this stuff then many of those people when they went happens because it's not a pleasure purchase so it's not like come come buy an ice cream right now you'll feel very good come by this pair of jeans and you look very good in it this is by this thing in the next 20 years if shit happens to you then you won't have as bad an impact as you could have had who wants to do that the tough and the only time you'll do it is then you see stuff happening to some people and you'll understand that's the only way to have a profitable business so both of those become your right to win your direct traffic and your better disclosures and orderly enough we luckily manage to get the money and you'll get a good call center operation as well which helps you convert more and that becomes just thought right to win if you would Just last couple of questions what are three two or three most common adjectives people in policy bazaar might use to describe you I think they would say honest to afford very passionate I think those two would be there there's a thing here which my daughter when she was about four years old and that has all the adjectives I can see intelligent those are okay on time swimmer sporty receiving this evening she's written that then because we have some chocolate or something she may not have got She's an intelligent girl so but if you think of a not very different here she's written anti-D intelligence independent independent on time determined you see a lot of mathematics in their sporty she's used word like is important and she did not write a you know she's the eye is starting with a small one straight forward just see how many times straight forward kind of words appear it's a pretty good reflection what she's written but these these days I must share this with you so these have stayed in this company pretty much from when the company started I can imagine because you said that she was not your soul she's 19 now and she was four years old and these have always stayed in my room and these nobody ever upped them out so and a lot of people use this room so anybody can just up these out also right but it is not written that you don't need to rob it out so that is a deep part so what I have given up for setting up policy bazaar is actually family and I think a lot of people understand that they don't say it but a lot of people here actually understand that this guy actually stayed away from family for 13 14 years so that was my next question how do you rate yourself how do you rate your performance as a founder CEO and as a parent so as a founder CEO I think we've done quite well and I mean as a parent how do you say I would say probably I would actually say eight on ten I probably could have raised funds at higher valuations in the past and whether I should have or not I don't know but I do believe I under I underplay our organization of it and so many founders do that much better than me I don't need to be that much better but I need to be a little better than I am and as a parent as a parent is a very difficult one because the kids have turned out well but I think a lot of the credit of that will eventually go to my wife who's actually been there with them right and at least my son says so so so I'll tell you my daughter says I'm a better parent my son says I'm not there when I'm required so and and my mother's always you know he always says that mummy's always been there so yeah there is a and he does send me on a guilt trip once in a while on that so there is there is that aspect but I always try to be connected to them and I think we are very connected the fact that we all run cycle and swim is testament to that but yeah I I wasn't there to drop them to school all the time or pick them up and you know all those things and shika had to be the only parent and she had to also work because please appreciate in the first six months when policy was set up I was on goal I didn't have money so this is not a rich person who said I'm a company we didn't have anything so shika had to she had two kids and she had to she was single parent and she had to return to working she's an insia graduate but she was not working before that she had to start working at a bank so I think she's had a very very tough life and I think clearly she's been the parent you know and but yeah that's that's how it is but I think I think I I give them very good I give them very good advice while being count kind so I think I think I've been a decent parent as well but I've not been there all the time. It's it's interesting that you use the word kind because it's not a word which is used very commonly in modern professional life kind or kindness so it's it's actually quite refreshing because my son pointed out to me one day when we were talking about some teacher and he said that this teacher is very kind and I'm like it's not an adjective that you hear a lot in professional settings we don't describe people as kind so what are the sentences I use very very often in policy without very very often whenever we're making any decision is kind is better than right it's a it's a thing I use all the time so anytime I get let's say a customer a customer employee mail or a customer mail or anything and I respond to it internally almost always I say and remember kind is better than right because in a decision you can sometimes be too right and to one kind yeah obviously the balance is a balance between the two kind is better than right is a lovely thought to end the interview with thank you so much thank you so so
